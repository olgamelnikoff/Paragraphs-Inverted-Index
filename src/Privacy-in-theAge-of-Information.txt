Privacy its rise and fall

According to some , privacy was the result of the growth of the middle
class who could afford better housing and their abode , even though
humble , became their castle . Liberalization of laws such as the one
that took the state out of the bedrooms recognized the right of people
to be left alone . However , this was only at the governmental level
since it had supreme power but the corporations were left to regulate
themselves. At the end of the first gilded age, the need was felt to
regulate the robber barons and their corporations . . This was done by
the emergence of the workers unions and the need to share the riches
with the worker . The later was implemented with a progressive tax
system that supported the common good by taxing the haves to transfer
to the have-nots .  This afforded the luxury of privacy to the not so
rich! It must be noted that recently, the Supreme Court of the largest
functioning democracy in the history of humankind has ruled that
privacy is a human right : this in spite of an inane pronouncement of a
kid who became fabulously rich and influential.


The tools and technology that are the roots of the privacy
exploitation required many developments: quite a number of these
occurred in the mid 20th century. The first of these was the
introduction of computers and the development of semiconductors, its
miniaturization and increase in computing power.  The interconnection
of computers and hence people was made possible with the introduction
of the Internet. In the early days, access to the internet was limited
to the academic communities, some businesses and government
agencies. The introduction of the web and the development of the
graphical browsers opened up the internet to an increasing number of
users.


The offer of web-based free email service by start ups fueled by
venture capitalists allowed these companies the continuous access to
all email communications of an increasing number of users worldwide!
The undeclared charge for this free service was and continues to be
the contents of their messages and these users who in turn attracted
more users and more contents; there being no laws to protect the
privacy of the contents of these messages, which are in plain
text. This clear text being the raw material for tailoring targeted
publicity to the users of this free email service was the raw material
used initially for monetizing the ‘free’ service.

The graphical web browser also opened up a new method of communicating
with family and friends. However, since the majority of users were
seduced by the allure of setting up a free web presence without the
need to be tech-savvy, this was the start of what we now call online
social networks(OSN). The OSN attracted not only friends and family
but complete strangers. This attraction of becoming a celebrity has
been the force that pushed up the number of such users to billions. To
this date, instead of recognizing themselves as publishers, these OSN
claim to be simple platforms and take no responsibility for the
content they provide which has created many problems, including
bullying, extreme self-harm, fake news, genocide and terrorist act
co-ordination.

The web opened up the internet to the non-tech savvy user. Instead of
creating tools to make the Internet service such as email to be used
privately, securely and easily accessible to the non-tech savvy or
offering it via the national postal service, the unimaginative
politicians let it be provided by venture capitalists.

A system such as the web robot and allowing any robot to be served
freely by the web servers was one of the biggest blunders made by the
web community.  The taking over of the web by the commercial players
and facilitating tracking in the web browser are other blunders driven
by monetizing the web. It is reported that there is an attempt to undo
the harm in the new web but again, some of the players are the same as
in the first web, and the same commercial pressure would jeopardize
this solution.

The cell phone which started out as a bulky device profited from the
miniaturization of semiconductor circuits and started getting smaller,
lighter and more popular. The addition of a screen and more computing
power and better and better networks transformed the cell phone from
an emergency device to a personal communication device. The tech giant
companies made sure that the new ‘smart’ cell phones have access to
their services and the cell phone replaced the personal computer and
the land line. The cell phone system also allowed bypassing the need
of setting up an extensive telecommunication infrastructure and the
need for laying and maintaining cabling and relay stations. This was
replaced by cell phone towers and relay stations. The mobile system
speeded up communication in emerging economies as well as the
developed ones.


With the growth of the internet and the mobile communication infrastructure, the opportunity of gathering data on individuals from their communications and interactions became relatively easy. The set up of the Global Position
System in the early seventies by the USAian government  along with the
worldwide free access to the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided precise location information. A system to use the GPS location is built into the
current generation of mobile hand sets. The many applications available for
the mobile phone made it possible to introduce services many of which require
SPS. The use of the global positioning system allowed the various applications
running on cell phones to keep abreast of the location of the user. Some of
these, useful to the user for applications such as directions and maps, allowed
the marketing of nearby businesses to the cell phone user.


Furthermore, the applications on the mobile system allowed their
developer to precisely know the whereabouts of the mobile device and
hence its owner.  These locations are recorded by the application
developer and the supplier of the mobile operating system. Along with
the web and the cell technology, the access to users data in their
communications and by tracking their use of the web and applying the
advances in computer science including data management and algorithms
for machine learning etc. created what Zuboff calls Surveillance
Capitalism. The exploitation of personal data by private
corporations is finally drawing the attention of scholars, and
columnists and it is finally reaching the masses. The addiction to the
cell phone means that one is constantly looking at it even when out in
company with friends and family for a meal or just walking around.


The recognization of corporations as a legal entity made it possible
to put in power politicians which reversed the progressive nature of
the taxation in the wrong belief that there would be a trickled down
effect from the haves to the have-nots. Unfortunately, this effect has
not occurred and the growth of the middle class has been halted and
reversed. Competition by having another company provide similar,
privacy oriented service, seems hardly possible. Because of the large
share of the market another similar OSN, even one such as Google+ did
not succeed.

1.1   Exposure to Privacy in the Computer Science Curriculum

Many of the current tech giants are headed by people who may have
followed a computer science program and/or “tech-geeks” some of them
being drop outs.  One can safely assume that the majority of the
coders could have had a computer science related education. However
their exposure to humanities and social sciences would have been very
limited if null as it is in many CS programs. The curriculum
recommendation from ACM/IEEE includes the following: “A computer
engineering curriculum must include preparation for professional
practice as an integral component. These practices encompass a wide
range of activities including management, ethics and values, written
and oral communication, working as part of a team, and remaining
current in a rapidly changing discipline.” However not much is said
about issues of privacy and security except if it is not
ethical. However, with the recklessness shown by the robber barons of
the late 20th - early 21st century who go ahead like bulls in a china
shop and seem to have no regards for a person’s privacy.


The sample curriculum for Computer science which runs into hundreds of
pages includes exposure of the student to Social Issues and
Professional Practice and the documents point out that “Graduates
should recognize the social, legal, ethical, and cultural issues
inherent in the discipline of computing. They must further recognize
that social, legal, and ethical standards vary internationally. They
should be knowledgeable about the interplay of ethical issues,
technical problems, and aesthetic values that play an important part
in the development of computing systems. Practitioners must understand
their individual and collective responsibility and the possible
consequences of failure.  They must understand their own limitations
as well as the limitations of their tools.” In the section SP/Privacy
and Civil Liberties which is 2 Core-Tier1 hours where philosophical,
legal, privacy tools and implications and related issues are
presented. This hardly seems adequate and is likely to run off the
proverbial duck’s back. Since some of the aspects of this
responsibility is not encouraged to be practiced in the rest of the
program the final impact is almost nil. What is puzzling is that in
Appendix C of this document where course exemplars are given, there is
not a single one just for SP/Privacy and Civil Liberties. One, given
on page 304 on Social Issues and Professional Practice, is part of a
course which includes Human Computer Interaction and Graphics and
Visualization. Another example is Ethics & the Information Age ,
(p436) which however does not touch on the philosophical issue of
property, personhood and the right of a person to privacy. In Stanford
university’s CS program the course CS181 – Computers, Ethics, and
Public Policy allocates a scant 1.6 hours to Privacy & Civil Liberties
 (p501).

The privacy and security framework of the Canadian Institute for Health
Information (CIHI), an independent, not-for-profit organization provides essential information on Canada’s health systems and the health of Canadians. Most
engineers and software designers are not very well exposed to privacy and may
have been exposed minimally to security. However they and the marketing
people would likely ignore most of the issues in such frameworks.

The privacy and security page of the USAian Federal Trade
Commission(FTC) has the following about data security: “Many companies
keep sensitive personal information about customers or employees in
their files or on their network. Having a sound security plan in place
to collect only what you need, keep it safe, and dispose of it
securely can help you meet your legal obligations to protect that
sensitive data. The FTC has free resources for businesses of any
size”.  The guidelines are only for self regulation and the penalty
is fairly small; as reported recently, about 22 million USD. The
issue addressed by FTC is based on the agreement it had with Facebook
for privacy but the FTC claims that the company “deceived consumers by
telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private,
and then repeatedly allowed it to be shared and made public”
. Compare this paltry sum with the one in the guidelines for the EU
which call for maximum penalties or 20 million Euros or up to 4% of
the world wide revenue for a single breach which can add up to
billions of Euros. In the USAian system the privacy issues are
being handled by a trade commission, not a human rights agency.

Even though there is so much concern about security, there have been
some large breaches in the recent years. Many systems store sensitive
information such as passwords in clear text. The fact that the tech
giants share information with third parties is enough for one to opt
out of any system that needs third parties to carry on their central
tasks.

2  Source of Privacy Violations

The biggest sources of privacy violations are invisible. On-line
shopping requires passing valuable personal information to big as well
as small retailers. Some of them are fly-by-night ones while others
are multi-billion dollar enterprises.  Many small fries are on the
coattails of specialized shopping portals. Many of these retailers, to
increase their revenues, turn around and sell the personal information
to data aggregators. The portals also could have access to such data
and can use it to direct publicity for products and service to the
users and with use of cookies and trackers all this data goes into
many different data repositories to be exploited, ad infinitum.

While shopping or doing any operation on line,, one is tracked by a
myriad of trackers. A case in point is a session with one’s own
bank. If one has a tracker reporting add-on in the browser, e.g.,
Privacy Badger, one see the trackers used by these banks to track
their own costumers and share the data with these third parties! A
question sent to the bank of why this is being done is never responded
to!

2.1   A Typical privacy agreement

When a person signs up as a user of most of the ‘free’ on-line
services or to services such as mobile phone supplier, she accepts,
unread much less with a clear understanding of what it implies, their
privacy policy which is linked to equally unread and not understood
data policy. These policies may be updated without the users’
consent. As an example if one considers the privacy policy  and the
data policy  of Facebook, which runs to, in the version currently
accessible, 7 and 9 pages respectively; it is no wonder no one reads
these and assumes that these privacy policies mean that the site will
keep her personal information private and would not share it without
her permission. Little does the unsuspecting person knows that she
is giving away a free license to persons and organizers who believe
that privacy is no longer a social norm.


The user is required to let the supplier of the service reserve the
right to process, sell, trade or rent aggregated or the users
information which is anonymized.  It is well known by now that most
anonymizing scheme can be thwarted by combining information from
multiple sources. The information that is up for grab includes1


Personal information: including name, mailing(postal) address, email
address, telephone number, IDs of accounts, device identifiers, PIN,
service provider information, account including credit card
credentials, passwords, records of all communications as well as
details of contacts.

Applications: All providers of applications have access to not only
their own application data but also may share this data with other
applications on the device. This looks like a modus operandi of all
application developers and 1 The following is based on the
privacy/data agreement of a number of organization including - Apple,
Blackberry, Google, Facebook, etc. as Zuboff says, anything that is
not guarded would be claimed by these new pirates.

Back-up data on cloud: Would have access to users’ personal information
including contacts, email addresses, calendar, memo, tasks, display pictures,
status messages, photos, audio, videos – the stated reason is to be able to
restore this information.

Cookies: These were introduced in the web space to overcome the
stateless nature of the web protocol. The reason for a stateless
nature of the web was due to the philosophy of free sharing of
knowledge. However, cookies and their derivatives have morphed into a
nefarious form to facilitate surveillance.

Financial Information: Any transaction through the system may require
credit status checking etc. any or all of which could be recorded and
shared with other parties.

Third party information: The service provider may combine your
information with ones obtained from other sources.

Retention of Personal information: Even after the expiry of any
direct association with the service provided it could be retained
perhaps in an anonimized form and may be used perpetually.

International operations and onward transfers: The service provider,
would require you to consent that your personal information may be collected,
used, processed, transferred or stored in multiple jurisdictions.

Communication: The service provider may communicate information,
surveys, marketing materials, advertisements or personalized
content. The service provider may share your personal information
within the service provider and with their service providers,
financial, insurance, legal, accounting or other advisors.

Here are some of the things these systems have your permission to lay
claim on! Any information and content you provide or they collect from
creating or sharing content, contents of messages or communications
with others. and all information provided while using any of their
products including information of the account. They collect details
about your connections, address books, logs, meta-data and contents of
all communications including all SMSs and emails; pattern of usage
including what, when, where, who (and use their algorithms to try to
figure out why!). All transactions made which includes purchases which
would include the details of the credit/debit cards used,
authentication information, addresses and contact information about
the transaction. In addition they have access to actions taken by your
contacts and the information they provide. Your location information
is used to determine where you live, where you go, what events you
attend and where you are at any point in time. All this information is
used to create targeted publicity which is tailored to influence you,
using your foibles determined by their unknown algorithms.


The proliferation of the internet via the medium of the web to offer
all types of services requires a user to sign-up using a user name and
a password. Since more and more services, such as news,
financial. Governmental. social and commercial are now offered through
the web a typical user may have scores of user IDs and passwords. The
tech giants, to increase their presence, have offered to enter into
an agreement with many of these services to let the users employ these
tech giants credentials to log into these services. Thus the tech
giants can trace the user not only on their own platform but can have
access to what other services are being used and whatever other
information the target service may provide the tech giant. What and
how the information these giants would glean besides associating yet
another data point in the profiles for these users is not advertised
or communicated to the user.

3 Privacy violation at any level of sharing

One of the culprits in the current loss of privacy is the USAian
system, its constitution and the outlook of its capitalistic
system. Whereas there are some forms of restraint for the USAian
governments collecting and using personal information in its
constitution and amendments, the private sector is left alone to do as
it pleases with a laissez faire self policing attitude. What the
citizens do not trust the government to spy on is allowed to the
private corporations.  That self regulation does not work is amply
illustrated in the recent Boeing 737 Max’s design flaws which led to
two deadly crashes. An optional display that showed the disagreement
of the angle of attack sensors on the Boeing Max required additional
cost in the millions for the plane.

Furthermore, the fact that Boeing was able to get away with not having
the Federal Aviation Agency(FAA) really act as an independent quality
control shows that self regulation is unrelaible. According to ,
. “The problems were apparently compounded by FAA rules allowing
manufacturers to essentially self-certify aircraft. Boeing reportedly
tried to speed up the process in order to catch its rival Airbus
A320neo, and pushed the FAA to give it more responsibility. There
wasn’t a complete and proper review of the documents,” a former Boeing
engineer said. “[The] review was rushed to reach certain certification
dates.” . The failure of the correct software and the required
equipment for a high priced air-frame leads one to conjecture the type
of security employed by many of these tech giants who have no
regulation, no oversight and no competition and pay little taxes. They
fail to reveal breach of security or the lack of it for months and
years. According to the press, Google did not reveal a security breach
for fear of regulations. 

With current internet and wireless technology, people actually pay to use the
free services in the form of internet connection monthly charges, buy and pay
the connection fees for ‘smart’ devices that allow them to be tracked. Unlike
criminals who are tracked by a tracking device imposed on them most consumers
now carry a tracking device and pay for it handsomely, every month including
for the bandwidth used for tracking.

The result of the USAian system, where the tech giants are based, is
that the private sector has laid claim on personal and private
information of sers of the myriad of devices that they own. Most of
the smart devices are controlled by just two operating platforms again
controlled by USAian tech giants. In addition, they control the
application stores that users can download the ‘apps’ from and earn a
percent of the fees for these applications. One wonders if this is not
an example of a monopoly! Example of such laying a stake, like the one
used in the gold rush of yore, is to claim all human experience as
free raw material without any concern for individual rights and
without any payment of any source. As Zuboff compares these to the
edict recited by the Spanish conquistadors and later the settlers of
the west in what is now known as the U. S. A. This edict gave the
conquistadors and the settlers some form of divine rights which
allowed them to usurp the lands of the existing people and displaced
them or wiped them out.
